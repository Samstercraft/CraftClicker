# What is CraftClicker?

CraftClicker is a bridge mod & modpack that combines Minecraft and Cookie Clicker into a single playthrough.

# Progress

So far I've only worked on the Cookie Clicker mod, and it currently just adds a test building. There's no point in using this software yet unless you are curious or want to work on it.

# Installation

## Cookie Clicker Mod

1. Install [Cookie Clicker Mod Manager (CCMM)](https://github.com/klattmose/CookieClickerModManager) (Browser extension for Firefox & Chrome)

2. Install an http server
While this repo is private you'll need to host the cookie_clicker_mod/main.js file locally.

3. Add the mod to CCMM
Open [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker)
At the far right of your address bar there should be a small cookie icon. Click it to open CCMM.
At the bottom of the menu click "+ Register new mod"
Enter the location of the main.js file in the URL field (eg. http://127.0.0.1:8080/main.js if you're using a standard http server, and hosting just the folder containing main.js). The name shouldn't matter, but it's called CraftClicker.

4. Reload the page.
